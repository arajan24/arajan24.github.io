								<h4>Soundmass Composition</h4>
								<p> This is a soundmass composition, which depends on a vertical workflow to layer and texture various sounds upon 
									each other to create impact and momentum. Multiple processing techniques were used in the creation of 
									this composition, including granular synthesis, tremolo effects, and reverb processing. These effects were
									applied to mundane everyday sounds from my sound library, including fans running, keys jangling, and 
									ping pong balls dropping. </p>
									
								<p> The composition itself utilizes a mix of percussive and sustained tones to provide variety in the soundscape.
									The overall structure of the composition is reminiscent of a tidal wave, as the composition slowly gains "mass"
									before crashing and eventually dissipating into silence.

								<h4>Text Sound Composition</h4>
								<p> This composition uses spoken text as the primary audio source. The human voice is used as 
									the object sonore, or the source material, and serves as an exploration of modifying the 
									voice in the context of an electroacoustic composition
								</p>
								<p> For my Text-Sound Composition, I used a transcript of the Apple iPhone 7 keynote, 
									specifically the portion in which they introduce the AirPods. The decision to remove the headphone jack was extremely controversial at the time, 
									and Apple as a company very rarely admits their mistakes and instead create justifications for any controversial decisions they make. 
									The thesis of my composition is how keynote speeches like these use carefully selected buzzwords to convince 
									the consumers and the press that they have everything carefully planned out. 
								</p>
								<p> Each time a buzzword is said, I begin repeating that word in the composition along with multiple processing techniques applied to it. 
									The main processing techniques I used were pitch shifting, granular synthesis, echoing, and the application of tremolo. 
									I created multiple layers of each soundbite and applied these processing techniques with variations between each layer so that it would create a chaotic soundscape.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ultimately, this composition is a little hypocritical, as I own many apple products myself. 
									However, I thought it was a somewhat humorous reaction to the pompousness of Apple’s keynote, 
									especially as they boasted their “courage” in removing the headphone jack.

								<h4>Economy of Source Material Composition</h4>
								<p> This composition was created entirely with only two samples: a tape measure shuffle and a viola bow. I chose these two samples because the first gives me more percussive elements and the second gives me a pitch that I can modify. 
									These samples were modified with various alectroacoustic processing techniques to create this composition.</p>
									
								<p> While writing the song, I was reminded of sci-fi elements and I designed the intro as a spaceship increasing in speed and suddenly crashing at the climax of the song. 
									The second half is much eerier to represent the uncertainty of what happens after the space ship crashes.
