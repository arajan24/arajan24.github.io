								<h2>Electroacoustic Composition</h2>
								<p>I have created many Electroacoustic composititions as a part of my classwork. Please check out a few of them below!</p>

								<h4>COVID-19 Data Sonification</h4>
								<p> This composition was created entirely with only two samples: a tape measure shuffle and a viola bow. I chose these two samples because the first gives me more percussive elements and the second gives me a pitch that I can modify. 
									These samples were modified with various alectroacoustic processing techniques to create this composition.</p>
									
								<p> While writing the song, I was reminded of sci-fi elements and I designed the intro as a spaceship increasing in speed and suddenly crashing at the climax of the song. 
									The second half is much eerier to represent the uncertainty of what happens after the space ship crashes.</p>

								<h4>Soundmass Composition</h4>
								<p> This is a soundmass composition, which depends on a vertical workflow to layer and texture various sounds upon 
									each other to create impact and momentum. Multiple processing techniques were used in the creation of 
									this composition, including granular synthesis, tremolo effects, and reverb processing. These effects were
									applied to mundane everyday sounds from my sound library, including fans running, keys jangling, and 
									ping pong balls dropping. </p>
									
								<p> The composition itself utilizes a mix of percussive and sustained tones to provide variety in the soundscape.
									The overall structure of the composition is reminiscent of a tidal wave, as the composition slowly gains "mass"
									before crashing and eventually dissipating into silence. </p>
