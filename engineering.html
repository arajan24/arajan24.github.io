								<h2>Engineering Projects</h2>
								<p> A large part of my engineering education has been focused on Signal Processing and Audio Engineering.
                                    Combining music and engineering has been truly interesting and a perfect blend of my interests. 
                                    These projects include embedded digital signal processing applications and electroacoustic/algorithmic compositions. 
                                    Please check out a few of my engineering projects below!
                                </p>

                                <h4><i>Pandemic!</i>: Data Sonification Composition</h4>
								
								<p> The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic was an event of unprecedented size that has affected people all around the world. 
									The virus, belonging to the coronavirus group of viruses, originated in Wuhan, China, and causes respiratory symptoms in the affected. 
									The virus itself spread in an exponential manner, with many countries establishing quarantines and lockdowns in an attempt to control the spread.</p>
								
								<p> <i>Pandemic!</i> is an electro-acoustic composition that intends to represent the global
									pandemic in a sonic medium. This piece features multiple components, with the basis of the
									sound being algorithmic composition. SuperCollider was used to algorithmically represent the data of confirmed cases in various
									countries through sound, and Logic Pro X was used to arrange and apply various electroacoustic 
									composition techniques. The countries represented are the United States, Brazil, China, Italy,
									Iran, and India, which are represented by the notes D, E, C, A, G, F respectively. SuperCollider
									was used to change properties of these tones, specifically the amplitude and the duration of the
									grains used in granular synthesis. The amplitudes of the tones are proportional to the number 
                                    of cases, as specified by the following formula:
                                </p>

                                <pre><code>decibelLevel = (((numCases/1158040) * 42) - 45)</code></pre>

								<p> Granular synthesis was also used to modify the tones to add a sense of chaos to the composition. 
                                    The durations of the grains are changed exponentially based on the number of confirmed cases, based on the following formula:</p>
                                
                                <pre><code>duration = ((3**(1/numCases)-1)/(3-1))*(3-0.01)+0.01)</code></pre> 

                                <p> The SuperCollider code used in the composition of this piece can be found <a href="https://github.com/arajan24/COVID-19-Data-Sonification">here</a>.
									Please listen to the full composition below!

								<h4>Self Harmonizing Android App</h4>
								<p>This project was my final project for Embedded Digital Signal Processing (ECE 420) 
                                    and was inspired by my love for A Cappella. As a large part of A Cappella music is 
                                    building chords, this application makes it easy to write harmonies into new arrangements. </p>
                                <p>
                                    The project is an Android application that generates a tone that harmonizes with the user as they sing into 
                                    a microphone as a real-time audio input. We utilized a modified autocorrelation method using clipping to 
                                    recognize the frequency of the userâ€™s voice and the Time-Domain Pitch Synchronous Overlap-Add 
                                    (TD-PSOLA) algorithm to output shifted frequency in real time. The use also has multiple options 
                                    for the number of harmonies to be outputted and the size of the interval between harmonies.
                                </p>
                                <p>The code for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/soosiey/Self-Harmonizer">here</a>. Please check out a short demo video of the app in action!</p>
